Leadership Assessment Survey &amp; Report - full-stack MVP built with Python, R, LaTeX, CSS/HTML

I had the opportunity of teaching executive leadership for a selected group of Physicians recently.  As we were about to start our course, we realized that we needed some kind of Leadership Profile Evaluation for our students.  So, I built by myself a full-stack MVP of a DISC Leadership Assessment from scratch, integrating Python & R.  

Some CSS/HTML was used to build a dynamic website (with Python Flask) and survey forms. All user data was stored by a simple SQL server, powered by Python.  Automated data analysis was made with RMarkdown, printing and emailing LaTeX pdf reports.

Integration between micro-services was supported by REST APIs.  The MVP was deployed in Google Cloud, and received dozens of positive feedback from the students of our course.  

Its source code openly available for the community (https://git.io/fjmHa).
